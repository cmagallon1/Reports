# The five dysfunctions of a team

# What learned from the book
This book mainly taught me that if you want to perform a good job and be successfull first you have to be 
good with your work team, if there's a bad atmosphere in the team you can't work well with your teammates,
that motivates to conflict, then all are angry, and that's when the company fails. Work in team, that's the
key for success in mostly cases. Also that, there're 5 mainly dysfunctions that can affect to any team, and
it's important have them identified, so we can avoid fall on them

# What surprised me?
I think that what surprised me more was the way in that the CEO of the story face the problems and respond
to the actions and comments that his team make, for example, how he handle the situation when mikey(a problematic
member of the team) quit, and also learn about this dysfunctions, beacause i didn't know a thing about this 
dysfunctions and, after read this book you can identify maybe problems in your team that maybe you didn't know
that you have

# What I'll be doing different from now
I will try to avoid fall in this dysfunctions talking with the team, actually after reading that one of the 
dysfunctions is lack of conclict, I started to do more comments when we do a meeting or something, because
keep your ideas for yourself is also not a good thing, and I also try to be honest with the team in certain 
topics, like when someone ask for opinions or in a retrospective
