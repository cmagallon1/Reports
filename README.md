# Mindset the new psychology of success

## Introduction to mindsets
"Mindset the new psychology of succes" was a book which really made me change my mind about the several
behaviors of a person depending on which kind of mentality does the person have. The book says that each
of us could have any of this two mindsets: fixed or growth. 

##Fixed mindset

People with fixed mindset believes that skills
or abilities must be a gift and it's not obtained by effort or practice, because whether you can't do something 
well since the beginning means that it's not for you. They think effort means weakness and also they don't accept 
any new challenge because they don't wanna show that they're not capable to do some tasks, doing this, they prove
his superiorit, and if for any reason they're not able fo finish a task or they have to put a lot of effort, 
they just give up.


## Growth mindset 
People with growth mindset are those who believe that skills, being a gift or not, can be obtained and improved by 
effort and dedication. They think that the effort is essential and don't hesitate taking new challenges because they 
believe that doing hard and new things is gonna help to learn a lot
