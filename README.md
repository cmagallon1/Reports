# Mindset the new psychology of success

## Introduction to mindsets
"Mindset the new psychology of success" was a book which really made me change my mind about the several
behaviors of a person depending on which kind of mindset does the person have. The book says that each
of us could have any of this two mindsets: fixed or growth. 

## Fixed mindset

People with fixed mindset believes that skills or abilities must be a gift and it's not obtained by effort or 
practice, because whether you can't do something well since the beginning means that it's not for you. They 
think effort means weakness and also they don't accept any new challenge because they don't wanna show that 
they're not capable to do some tasks, doing this, they prove his superiority and if for any reason they're 
not able fo finish a task or have to put a lot of effort, they just give up.


## Growth mindset 
People with growth mindset are those who believe that skills, being a gift or not, can be obtained and improved by 
effort and dedication. They think that the effort is essential and don't hesitate taking new challenges because they 
believe that doing hard and new things is gonna help to learn a lot

## Mindsets in many fields
The book tell us about several experiments done by the author in which she described how this two mindsets react to 
different fields like love, business, sports, etc. In each field the author describe true examples about the reactions 
of both mindsets. Also the author gave us examples of other situations like labels, stereotypes, depression, shyness.
People with fixed mindset tend to succumb, in case of stereotypes and labels, to comments done by others and lead to a 
feeling of not belong where they are and thinking that they're bad in what they do, even when they receive feedback 
they're agresive, because they're always looking for a way to prove their intelligence. In shyness case, when a 
person try to get close with a fixed mindset person, this kind of person always try to get people away, reaching a
point where they even hurt the feelings of other people and when fixed mindset people are depressed, they can be easily beaten.

Growth mindset people are not affected by labels or stereotypes, when they're shy, and someone starts to talk with 
them, after a few minutes they start to feel more confident and little by litte they're not shy anymore and in 
depression, they're not affected, of course they've depression but they dont let themselves be defeated.

## Advices 
One of the most interesting parts of the books was a section of questions and answers, where the author explain more
about this two mindsets, but for me, the most important was known that we all can have both mindsets, we just have 
to learn how to live with them also she gave us some tips in case of being fathers, coaches, etc.
